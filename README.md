# AutoReferee-client

## What is it?

**AutoReferee-client** is a client-side mod that adds an extra layer for viewers of the different e-sport genres in minecraft. It adds different GUI/HUD elements that give statistics about the ongoing game. No more *"this player might be close to death because he took a lot of hits but how close, we don't know."* Simply because every player's health is rendered above the player! No more questions about the status of the game because there's an easy overview for that too. 

And if you have the latest version of the client (and of the server-side plugin), you'll even be able to teleport to various player- or teamspecific locations right from the GUI. Find more information about the mod in [our wikis](https://github.com/rmct/AutoReferee-client/wiki/How-to-use-the-mod).

You can download the latest version of the mod [on the jenkins server](http://jenkins.musclecraft.net:8080/job/AutoReferee-client/) or [in the releases tab](https://github.com/rmct/AutoReferee-client/releases) of this repository.

##Server-plugin
This client-side mod requires a server-side plugin. Currently there are two plugins out there that are supported by me (the main [AutoReferee plugin](https://github.com/rmct/AutoReferee) and the [TesseractUHC plugin](https://github.com/itsmartin/TesseractUHC)). But if you're a plugin maker, you can find [more information](https://github.com/rmct/AutoReferee-client/wiki/Autoreferee-Message-Protocol) about how to adapt your plugin to be able to work with this mod in our wikis.
